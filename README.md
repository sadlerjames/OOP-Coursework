# Object Oriented Programming Coursework

### Structure of Project
Interface files (`SocialMediaPlatform.java` and `MiniSocialMediaPlatform.java`) defines how the front end interacts with the backend. We don't write any code in the platform files. The interface is like a specification file of what front end wants. 

Ignore `BadSocialMedia.java` and `BadMiniSocialMedia.java`
SocialMedia.java is the code for the methods in the interface files.

Everything we write (e.g. classes) will be called from the `SocialMedia.java` file.
