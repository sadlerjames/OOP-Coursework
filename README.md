# Object Oriented Programming Coursework

### Structure of Project
Interface files (`SocialMediaPlatform.java` and `MiniSocialMediaPlatform.java`) defines how the front end interacts with the backend. We don't write any code in the platform files. The interface is like a specification file of what front end wants. 

Ignore `BadSocialMedia.java` and `BadMiniSocialMedia.java`
SocialMedia.java is the code for the methods in the interface files.

Everything we write (e.g. classes) will be called from the `SocialMedia.java` file.

TODO: 
 
- Safety checks in getters/setters? 


- Move methods back out to classes where possible (showIndividualPost?)/have objects do more of the computational load
- Go through lecture slides/workshops, implement as many concepts as possible (Design by contract!)
- Should BasePost be an abstract class?
- Check follow all java style conventions (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html - CHECK that this is correct link)
- Check interface/method declarations unchanged from provided
- Check through all assertions!
- Generate printout, extract jar and check, etc
